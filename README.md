# Cyber @ UCI Website

This is a website for Cyber @ UCI -- a student organization at the University
of California, Irvine dedicated to cybersecurity in all its forms.

The site was built off of Massively, a theme for Jekyll which generates the
html files you see on our website today.

## About massively
