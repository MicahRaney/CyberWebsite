## We made it to Regionals!
For the first time in Cyber @ UCI's history, our CCDC team made it to regionals!
From twenty one competing schools, UCI rose to fourth place, solidying our seat
in the upcoming Western Regional competition! We also got a feature on [UCI ICS's
In the News](https://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/view_news?id=1499), so check that out.

### Regionals?
Every year, the top eight teams from the region get to spend three days in a
live-network environment competing for a coveted spot at the national competition.

### It's Cram Time
I'll keep this short because we have a **lot** of work to do. Regionals are just the start,
but I know I speak for the team when I say we are excited for the chance to compete on a larger
regional and national stage.

See you at Regionals!
